This is my current portofolio .. after starting this journey of coding on the 
1st of May 2022, and reading about multiple people's stories on how they got into coding, Almost if
not all of them, said that having a portofolio is an important evidence to showcase the skills and abilities
to code, design and build.
So if you are interested in knowing the code behind my website, here's mine.
and if you, the person reading this, are starting you developer journey as well, I hope that you find here some ready to use elements
that you can use and have a way to present your projects.
